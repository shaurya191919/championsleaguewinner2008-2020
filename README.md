# Champions League Winners Project

This project demonstrates routing and dynamic routing in Node.js using Express framework. It features a main page displaying images of UEFA Champions League winners from 2008 to 2020. Additionally, each year has its own routed page displaying the image of the winner for that particular year. The project utilizes the Path package for file and directory path manipulation and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for views. CSS styles are applied to enhance the visual presentation of the web pages.
